## Technologies Used
- **Excel**: Pivot Tables, Functions, Charts, and Slicers for data analysis and visualization.

## Steps Covered

1. **Requirement Gathering**: Collected requirements from the client for the types of analysis and insights needed.
2. **Stakeholder Identification**: Identified key stakeholders involved in the project.
3. **Data Cleaning**: Cleaned the dataset based on client specifications, including handling missing values and correcting data inconsistencies.
4. **Data Processing**: Added customized columns and transformed data to fit the analysis requirements.
5. **Data Analysis**: Used Pivot Tables and Excel functions to analyze the dataset, including accident severity, casualty counts, vehicle types, and road conditions.
6. **Data Visualization**: Created charts and custom sheets to display the insights gained from the analysis.
7. **Report/Dashboard Creation**: Developed an interactive dashboard to present key metrics and trends.

## Key Metrics Calculated

The following metrics were calculated for the dashboard:

- **Total Casualties**: Overall count of casualties across all accidents
- **Total Fatal Casualties**: Number of fatalities and their percentage of total casualties
- **Total Serious Casualties**: Number of serious injuries and their percentage of total casualties
- **Total Slight Casualties**: Number of slight injuries and their percentage of total casualties
- **Casualties by Vehicle Type**: Casualty distribution across different vehicle types
- **Monthly Trend of Casualties**: Trends showing monthly changes in casualties
- **Casualties by Road Types**: Distribution of casualties by road type
